Hi my name is Caleb, and I am a 2nd-year student at Washington College majoring in Computer Science.

### More Information

I enjoy drawing, playing tennis and guitar. There's a good chance you'll see me running around campus trying to make it to class on time.
You can also find me in the Quantitative Skills Center(QSC) on the first day of the week.
